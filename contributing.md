### Choosing an Issue

Issues are listed under said tab on the main GH repo page. If you find an issue that you would like to work on please leave a comment under that issue. Feel free to begin working on that issue while you wait for a response, but know that there may be additional details for that issue that can be addressed in the response, along with answering any questions you may have about the issue.

### Working on an Issue

Check out to a branch that describes the changes being made, branch names should be in capitalized camel case

```git checkout -b YourBranchName```

Make any relevant changes. If you make changes that require the addition of tests or the updating of tests please do so. Also ensure that there are no linter errors and that the test suite is fully passing before you make a pull request. Once you are finished with an issue, rebase your work and then push the branch to the remote (`git push origin YourBranchName`) and make a pull request on GitHub.

In your pull request, please provide a short description of the issue that the changes are addressing and unless a method is described in the initial issue, how you went about solving that issue (or perhaps why you went about solving it a certain way). Your PR will then be reviewed, so keep an eye out for comments that might need addressing.
